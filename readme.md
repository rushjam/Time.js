# Outline

Here's a rough outline for what we'll be learning today...

1. Creating a simple utility library
2. Making the library modular and tree-shakeable with ES modules
3. Converting it to a chainable, immutable library with OOP
4. Providing developers with hooks to customize how it works
5. Bundling a library for distribution and performance
